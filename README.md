# WeatherApp
Simple weather app

An application that displays the 7-day forecast for a specific city. You can search for different cities by name and it will dynamically update the page.

I tried to make it as user-friendly as possible, aiming for a simplistic and minimal design.

Coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Utilized Chart.js to generate the graphs: http://www.chartjs.org/.  
The app pulls data from OpenWeatherMap API: http://openweathermap.org/.
